// copy over following
// add time ticks so for k ticks do movement in one direction with noise
// almost as if doing chasing until one point
// then do randomwalk for k/2
// then go to next point calculated randomly
// remember to adjust to new bresenham as line goes on
// could actually call chasing in chasing_prob.c with different points like from diver.c
